In the afternoon, explore the Bahia Palace, a masterpiece of Moroccan architecture with its painted ceilings and lush gardens.

            <p>Leave the city behind and drive into the High Atlas Mountains, North Africa's tallest range. Wind through dramatic passes with breathtaking views of terraced valleys and red-earth Berber villages clinging to mountainsides. Stop in the Ourika Valley or Imlil, a gateway village to Mount Toubkal (4,167m), North Africa's highest peak. Trek through walnut groves and visit a traditional Berber home for a lunch of tagine cooked over open fire. Learn about Berber culture, their centuries-old agricultural traditions, and the significance of the Atlas Mountains as a cultural divide between the Sahara and the Atlantic coast. Return to Marrakech or continue to Ait Benhaddou.</p>

Continue through the Valley of Roses and Dades Gorge to reach Merzouga at the edge of Erg Chebbi. In the late afternoon, mount camels for a trek into the towering sand dunes, reaching your desert camp as the sun paints the Sahara in fiery colors. Enjoy a traditional Berber dinner with drumming under a sky ablaze with stars.</p>
            <p>Day 5 begins with a desert sunrise from the top of the dunes, a transcendent experience of silence and light. After breakfast at camp, return to Merzouga and begin the journey north toward Fez through the Ziz Valley, passing palm oases, crumbling kasbahs, and the dramatic Ziz Gorge. Stop in Midelt or Ifrane along the way.</p>

            <p>Arrive in Fez, Morocco's spiritual and intellectual capital. Day 6 is dedicated to Fez el-Bali, the world's largest car-free urban area. With a licensed guide, navigate the medina's 9,000 winding alleys, discovering the ancient Chouara Tanneries where leather is still dyed in stone vats using medieval techniques, the Al Quaraouiyine University (founded in 859 AD, the world's oldest existing university), and the ornate Bou Inania Madrasa. Visit artisan workshops producing ceramics, zellige tilework, and brass lanterns.</p>

            <h3>Day 8: Chefchaouen &amp; Departure</h3>
            <p>Early morning drive northwest through rolling hills and olive groves to Chefchaouen, the legendary Blue City. Nestled in the Rif Mountains at 660 meters, the entire old town is washed in shades of blue, from powder to cobalt to indigo. Explore the compact medina, visit the 15th-century kasbah and its ethnographic museum, and photograph the endlessly photogenic blue-washed lanes.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Getting There &amp; Around</h3>
            <p>International flights arrive at Marrakech Menara Airport (RAK). Departure is typically from Tangier Ibn Battouta Airport (TNG) or Fez-Saiss Airport (FEZ). Overland travel by private vehicle or shared minibus covers all transfers between cities. Roads are generally good, though mountain passes require experienced drivers. Distances are significant: Marrakech to Merzouga is approximately 9 hours, while Fez to Chefchaouen is about 4 hours.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Morocco's currency is the Dirham (MAD). ATMs are widely available in cities. Budget travelers can manage on $50-80/day with guesthouses and street food. Mid-range riads cost $60-150/night. Credit cards are accepted at larger establishments but cash is essential in souks and rural areas. Tipping is customary: 10-15% in restaurants, 20-50 MAD for guides, and small tips for porters and riad staff.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Culture &amp; Etiquette</h3>
            <p>Morocco is an Islamic country with conservative customs. Dress modestly, especially when visiting mosques (non-Muslims cannot enter most mosques except Hassan II in Casablanca). Remove shoes before entering homes and riads. Use your right hand for eating and greetings. During Ramadan, avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in public during daylight hours. Learning basic Arabic or French phrases is appreciated.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Visa &amp; Entry</h3>
            <p>Citizens of many countries including the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Australia can enter Morocco visa-free for up to 90 days. Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months. No vaccinations are required for entry, though hepatitis A and typhoid are recommended. Morocco is generally very safe for tourists; standard precautions against petty theft in busy areas are sufficient.</p>
