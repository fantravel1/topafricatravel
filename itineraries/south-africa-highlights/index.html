Alternatively, organized Garden Route tours and the Baz Bus hop-on-hop-off service are available. For Kruger, you can self-drive through the park or join guided safari vehicles."

            <h3>Getting There &amp; Around</h3>
            <p>International flights arrive at Cape Town International Airport (CPT). Departure is from O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB) in Johannesburg or Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport (MQP). The Garden Route is best driven by rental car (excellent roads, left-hand driving). Internal flights connect Cape Town to Johannesburg (2 hours) and Johannesburg to Kruger (1 hour). Alternatively, drive the entire route for maximum flexibility.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>South Africa's currency is the Rand (ZAR). The country offers excellent value compared to other safari destinations. Budget travelers can manage on $80-120/day. Mid-range options run $150-250/day. Kruger park entrance is approximately $25/day for international visitors. ATMs are widely available. Credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. Tipping: 10-15% in restaurants, ZAR 100-200 per person per game drive for guides and trackers.</p>

            <h3>Visa &amp; Entry</h3>
            <p>Citizens of many countries including the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Australia can enter South Africa visa-free for 90 days. Your passport must be valid for 30 days beyond your departure date and have at least 2 blank pages. No vaccinations are mandatory for entry, but hepatitis A and typhoid are recommended.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>What to Pack</h3>
            <p>South Africa has diverse climates, so layer your clothing. Cape Town can be windy; bring a windbreaker. The Garden Route is mild; bring comfortable walking shoes and rain gear. For Kruger safaris, pack neutral-colored clothing, binoculars, sunscreen, insect repellent, and a warm fleece for early morning game drives. A good camera with zoom lens is essential. South Africa uses Type M power plugs (large 3-pin round). Adapters are available at airports and shops.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Renting a car is the best way to experience the Garden Route at your own pace. Roads are excellent, well-signposted, and driving is on the left side (same as UK). The N2 highway along the Garden Route is one of Africa's most scenic drives. Rental cars are affordable by international standards, starting from around $25-40 per day. Alternatively, organized Garden Route tours and the Baz Bus hop-on-hop-off service are available. For Kruger, you can self-drive through the park or join guided safari vehicles.</p>
