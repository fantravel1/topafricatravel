After settling in, begin exploring the mother of all cities. Visit the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square, home to over 120,000 artifacts including the golden treasures of Tutankhamun and the Royal Mummies Room. The sheer density of pharaonic treasures is overwhelming. In the evening, take a felucca ride on the Nile at sunset, watching Cairo's skyline glow in golden light.

Explore the Pyramid of Khafre and the smaller Pyramid of Menkaure. Face the enigmatic Great Sphinx, the oldest monumental sculpture in the world. Optional: enter the Great Pyramid's narrow passages to reach the King's Chamber deep inside. After lunch with views of the pyramids, continue to Saqqara to visit the Step Pyramid of Djoser, the world's first monumental stone structure (c. 2670 BC), and the beautifully painted Mastaba of Ti.

            <p>Day 5: Cross the Nile to the West Bank, the realm of the dead. Enter the Valley of the Kings where 63 royal tombs were carved deep into the limestone hills, including the tomb of Tutankhamun. The vibrant wall paintings depicting the pharaohs' journey to the afterlife are astonishingly preserved. Visit the Temple of Hatshepsut, Egypt's greatest female pharaoh, carved into the cliffs at Deir el-Bahari. Stop at the Colossi of Memnon, two 18-meter statues guarding the entrance to the vanished mortuary temple of Amenhotep III. Optional hot air balloon ride at dawn over the West Bank.</p>

The gentle rhythm of the Nile sets the pace as you pass palm-fringed banks, sugar cane fields, and timeless mud-brick villages. Stop at the Temple of Edfu, the best-preserved temple in Egypt, dedicated to the falcon god Horus. Its massive pylon gateway and inner sanctum are breathtaking in their completeness. Continue sailing through the afternoon, watching fishermen cast nets and water buffalo bathe at the river's edge.</p>
            <p>Day 7: Morning visit to Kom Ombo, a unique double temple dedicated to both the crocodile god Sobek and the falcon god Horus.

            <p>A full day exploring Aswan, Egypt's sunniest and most relaxed city. Morning boat trip to the island Temple of Philae, dedicated to the goddess Isis and rescued from rising Nile waters by a UNESCO project that relocated it stone by stone to Agilkia Island.

            <p>Pre-dawn departure for the 3-hour drive (or short flight) south to Abu Simbel, one of Egypt's most awe-inspiring monuments. The Great Temple of Ramesses II features four colossal 20-meter statues of the pharaoh carved directly from the cliff face, guarding an interior with vivid wall reliefs depicting the Battle of Kadesh. Next door, the smaller Temple of Hathor, dedicated to Queen Nefertari, is equally stunning. The entire complex was cut apart and reassembled 65 meters higher in the 1960s to save it from Lake Nasser's rising waters, one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th century. Return to Aswan for your departure flight via Cairo, carrying the grandeur of ancient Egypt in your heart.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Egypt's currency is the Egyptian Pound (EGP). Egypt offers excellent value for travelers. Budget travelers can manage on $40-70/day. Mid-range travel runs $100-200/day. Pyramids entry is approximately $13, Valley of the Kings $12, Karnak $10. ATMs are widely available in cities. Credit cards are accepted at hotels, cruise ships, and larger restaurants.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Visa &amp; Entry</h3>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>What to Pack</h3>

A warm layer for cool desert evenings and air-conditioned interiors. Modest clothing for mosques: women should carry a scarf to cover shoulders and hair. A good camera and portable charger. Bring hand sanitizer and basic medications as Egyptian pharmacies may not stock familiar brands.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Egypt's major tourist sites are generally safe and heavily guarded. Cairo, the Giza Pyramids, Luxor, Aswan, and Nile cruise routes have strong security presence and tourist police. Use licensed guides and reputable tour operators. Take normal precautions against petty theft in crowded areas. Women should dress modestly outside resort areas. The main tourist circuits covered in this itinerary are well-established and safe. Always check your government's latest travel advisories before departure. Travel insurance is recommended.</p>
