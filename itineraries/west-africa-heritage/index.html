The Harmattan wind (December-February) can cause hazy skies in northern Ghana but does not significantly impact travel. The rainy season (May-October) makes some rural roads difficult, particularly access to Mole National Park. Senegal's rainy season peaks July-September. For wildlife viewing at Mole, the late dry season (February-March) is optimal as animals gather around shrinking water sources."

Anti-malaria prophylaxis is strongly recommended for all areas. Consult a travel health clinic 6-8 weeks before departure. Bring insect repellent with DEET and sleep under mosquito nets. Tap water is not safe to drink; use bottled or purified water throughout your trip."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The most practical way to travel between Ghana and Senegal is by air. Direct flights between Accra and Dakar take approximately 3.5 hours and are operated by several West African airlines. Overland travel is possible but takes multiple days through Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and other countries, requiring multiple visas and border crossings. We recommend flying from Accra (or Tamale near Mole) to Dakar to maximize your time at each destination. Book flights in advance as routes can sell out during peak season."

In the nearby village of Bonwire, watch master weavers produce kente cloth on traditional looms, each pattern telling a story or conveying a proverb. Visit an adinkra stamping workshop to learn about these Ashanti symbols of wisdom. Afternoon visit to Kumasi Fort, a relic of the Anglo-Ashanti Wars, housing the Armed Forces Museum.</p>

            <p>Day 7: Early departure for the long drive north to Mole National Park (approximately 6 hours through the savanna). Mole is Ghana's largest wildlife reserve, protecting 4,577 square kilometers of Guinea savanna woodland. Check in to the cliff-top lodge overlooking two waterholes frequented by elephants and arrive in time for an afternoon game drive. Spot elephants, warthogs, baboons, kob antelopes, and an array of birdlife against the backdrop of golden savanna.</p>
            <p>Day 8: The highlight of Mole is the walking safari, a rare and thrilling way to experience African wildlife on foot.

The proximity to wild elephants on foot is breathtaking. Afternoon visit to the Larabanga Mosque, one of West Africa's oldest mosques (c. 1421), a striking example of Sudano-Sahelian architecture.

            <p>Take the 20-minute ferry from Dakar to Gor&eacute;e Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Africa's most historically significant places. This small, car-free island was a center of the transatlantic slave trade for over 300 years. Visit the House of Slaves (Maison des Esclaves) and stand at the Door of No Return, where enslaved Africans took their last steps on home soil. The island's pastel-colored colonial buildings, bougainvillea-draped streets, and art galleries create a hauntingly beautiful contrast with its painful history.

            <p>Day 12: Drive north to Saint-Louis (approximately 4 hours), Senegal's former colonial capital and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city occupies a narrow island in the Senegal River, connected by the iconic Faidherbe Bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel's workshop. Explore the island's faded colonial architecture, colorful horse-drawn carts, and atmospheric streets. Visit the Saint-Louis Museum and the fishing quarter of Guet Ndar, a dense neighborhood where hundreds of brightly painted pirogues launch daily into the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>Day 13: Morning excursion to the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, a UNESCO site and the third-largest ornithological park in the world.

            <h3>Day 14: Lac Rose &amp; Departure</h3>
            <p>Drive south from Saint-Louis to Lac Rose (Lac Retba), a stunning pink-hued lake colored by Dunaliella salga algae and high salt content (up to 40%, rivaling the Dead Sea). Watch salt harvesters wade into the rose-colored waters, their bodies coated in shea butter for protection, scooping salt from the lakebed as they have for generations. Float effortlessly in the dense brine. Visit a local village and enjoy a farewell lunch of Senegalese grilled fish.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Getting There &amp; Around</h3>
            <p>International flights arrive at Accra's Kotoka International Airport (ACC). The Ghana segment uses a combination of private vehicle and domestic flights (Accra-Tamale for Mole). A flight connects Accra to Dakar (approximately 3.5 hours). In Senegal, overland transfers by private vehicle cover all routes. Departure is from Dakar's Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS). Roads in Ghana are generally good on main routes; Senegal's highways are excellent.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Ghana uses the Cedi (GHS); Senegal uses the West African CFA Franc (XOF). ATMs are available in major cities but scarce in rural areas; bring sufficient cash for Mole and Saint-Louis. Budget travelers can manage on $50-80/day. Mid-range travel runs $100-180/day. Mobile money (MTN, Orange Money) is widely used. Tipping is appreciated: 10% in restaurants, small tips for guides and porters.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Health &amp; Vaccinations</h3>
            <p>Yellow fever vaccination is mandatory for both Ghana and Senegal. Additional recommended vaccines: hepatitis A/B, typhoid, meningitis, and rabies. Malaria prophylaxis is essential. Drink only bottled or purified water. Bring insect repellent with DEET and long-sleeved clothing for evenings. Travel health insurance with medical evacuation coverage is strongly recommended. Pharmacies in major cities are well-stocked.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Visa &amp; Entry</h3>
            <p>Ghana requires a visa for most nationalities, obtainable online or at embassies ($60-150 depending on nationality). Senegal allows visa-free entry for citizens of many countries including the US, UK, and EU for stays up to 90 days. Passports must be valid for 6+ months with at least 2 blank pages. Both countries require a yellow fever vaccination certificate. Print copies of all travel documents as backup.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">The best time to visit Ghana and Senegal is during the dry season from November to March. Temperatures are warm but not extreme, humidity is lower, and roads are in good condition. The Harmattan wind (December-February) can cause hazy skies in northern Ghana but does not significantly impact travel. The rainy season (May-October) makes some rural roads difficult, particularly access to Mole National Park. Senegal's rainy season peaks July-September. For wildlife viewing at Mole, the late dry season (February-March) is optimal as animals gather around shrinking water sources.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">Do I need vaccinations for West Africa?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Yes, a yellow fever vaccination certificate is mandatory for entry into both Ghana and Senegal. Additional recommended vaccinations include hepatitis A and B, typhoid, meningitis (especially during dry season), and rabies for extended stays. Anti-malaria prophylaxis is strongly recommended for all areas. Consult a travel health clinic 6-8 weeks before departure. Bring insect repellent with DEET and sleep under mosquito nets. Tap water is not safe to drink; use bottled or purified water throughout your trip.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How do I travel between Ghana and Senegal?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">The most practical way to travel between Ghana and Senegal is by air. Direct flights between Accra and Dakar take approximately 3.5 hours and are operated by several West African airlines. Overland travel is possible but takes multiple days through Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and other countries, requiring multiple visas and border crossings. We recommend flying from Accra (or Tamale near Mole) to Dakar to maximize your time at each destination. Book flights in advance as routes can sell out during peak season.</p>
