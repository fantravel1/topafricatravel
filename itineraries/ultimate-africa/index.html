          "text": "Planning a multi-country Africa trip requires careful coordination of flights, visas, vaccinations, and seasonal timing. Start by choosing your priority regions and working with the optimal season (June-October is best for East African safaris). Book internal flights early as connections between African countries can be limited. Apply for all necessary visas well in advance. Ensure your vaccination records are up to date, especially yellow fever for East Africa. A 21-day trip like this one typically uses 4-5 internal flights to connect the countries efficiently. Working with an experienced tour operator or using a detailed itinerary like this one simplifies the logistics significantly."

          "text": "A 21-day multi-country Africa trip typically costs between $5,000 and $15,000 per person depending on accommodation level, travel style, and season. Budget-conscious travelers staying in basic lodges and guesthouses can manage around $5,000-7,000 including internal flights. Mid-range travelers using comfortable lodges and tented camps should budget $8,000-12,000. Luxury travelers choosing premium safari lodges, boutique riads, and five-star hotels will spend $12,000-15,000 or more. International flights to and from Africa are additional. The biggest variable is accommodation in safari areas, where prices range dramatically from budget camping to ultra-luxury."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For this multi-country itinerary, a yellow fever vaccination is mandatory for Kenya and Tanzania, and you will need the certificate when crossing borders. Recommended vaccinations include hepatitis A and B, typhoid, meningitis, and rabies. Anti-malaria prophylaxis is essential for Kenya, Tanzania, and the Kruger area of South Africa. Morocco does not require specific vaccinations. South Africa requires a yellow fever certificate only if arriving from an endemic country (which Kenya and Tanzania are). Consult a travel health clinic 6-8 weeks before departure. Comprehensive travel insurance with medical evacuation is strongly recommended."

            <h3>Day 1: Arrive in Marrakech, Morocco</h3>
            <p>Arrive at Marrakech Menara Airport and transfer to a traditional riad in the medina. After settling in, explore the Bahia Palace with its intricate zellige tilework and painted cedar ceilings. As evening falls, plunge into the sensory overload of Jemaa el-Fna: snake charmers, Gnawa musicians, henna artists, and endless food stalls. Sample Moroccan street food, including lamb tagine, msemen flatbread, and freshly squeezed orange juice. A rooftop dinner overlooking the square sets the stage for the adventure ahead.</p>

            <p>Three magnificent days in the Serengeti, Africa's most iconic safari destination.

Black rhinos graze near Ngoitokitok Spring, massive bull elephants wander through the Lerai Forest, lions command the open grasslands, and flamingos streak the soda lake pink.

              <p itemprop="text">Planning a multi-country Africa trip requires careful coordination of flights, visas, vaccinations, and seasonal timing. Start by choosing your priority regions and working with the optimal season (June-October is best for East African safaris). Book internal flights early as connections between African countries can be limited. Apply for all necessary visas well in advance. Ensure your vaccination records are up to date, especially yellow fever for East Africa. A 21-day trip like this one typically uses 4-5 internal flights to connect the countries efficiently. Working with an experienced tour operator or using a detailed itinerary like this one simplifies the logistics significantly.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">A 21-day multi-country Africa trip typically costs between $5,000 and $15,000 per person depending on accommodation level, travel style, and season. Budget-conscious travelers staying in basic lodges and guesthouses can manage around $5,000-7,000 including internal flights. Mid-range travelers using comfortable lodges and tented camps should budget $8,000-12,000. Luxury travelers choosing premium safari lodges, boutique riads, and five-star hotels will spend $12,000-15,000 or more. International flights to and from Africa are additional. The biggest variable is accommodation in safari areas, where prices range dramatically from budget camping to ultra-luxury.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">For this multi-country itinerary, a yellow fever vaccination is mandatory for Kenya and Tanzania, and you will need the certificate when crossing borders. Recommended vaccinations include hepatitis A and B, typhoid, meningitis, and rabies. Anti-malaria prophylaxis is essential for Kenya, Tanzania, and the Kruger area of South Africa. Morocco does not require specific vaccinations. South Africa requires a yellow fever certificate only if arriving from an endemic country (which Kenya and Tanzania are). Consult a travel health clinic 6-8 weeks before departure. Comprehensive travel insurance with medical evacuation is strongly recommended.</p>
