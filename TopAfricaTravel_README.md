## 🧠 Core Philosophy

TopAfricaTravel is **not a booking site**.  
It is a **continent-first travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- cluster destinations & experiences
- generate itineraries from verified components
- translate cultural context
- surface patterns across countries

Humans are required to:
- validate cultural accuracy
- prevent stereotypes
- ensure local respect
- review safety & access guidance

---

### Core Entities
- Country

- Experience
- Cultural Theme
- Itinerary
- Seasonality Window
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links geographically and culturally
- is programmatically generatable
