The cloth features vibrant geometric patterns in bold colors, with each design carrying specific symbolic meaning related to Ashanti history, philosophy, and proverbs. The village of Bonwire, approximately 18 kilometers from Kumasi, is the birthplace and primary production center of kente cloth. Here you can watch master weavers working on traditional narrow-strip looms, learn about the symbolism of different patterns, and purchase authentic kente directly from the craftspeople."

During the celebration, the Asantehene (Ashanti King) holds court in full regalia, seated on a replica of the legendary Golden Stool, while sub-chiefs and queen mothers pay their respects in a display of drumming, dancing, and ceremonial pageantry.

On day two, take a craft village tour: visit Bonwire for kente weaving, Ntonso for adinkra cloth stamping, and Ahwiaa for woodcarving. If you have a third day, visit the Kumasi Fort and Military Museum, the Okomfo Anokye Sword site, and the KNUST campus with its cultural center.

            <h3>Manhyia Palace: Seat of the Ashanti King</h3>
            <p>Manhyia Palace is the official residence of the Asantehene, the king of the Ashanti people, and the spiritual center of one of Africa's most powerful historic kingdoms. The original palace, built in 1925 by the British as part of the return from exile of King Prempeh I, is now a museum showcasing the history of Ashanti royalty through photographs, personal effects, and ceremonial objects. The current Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, resides in the adjacent modern palace and holds court during the spectacular Akwasidae festival every six weeks.</p>

            <h3>Kejetia Market: West Africa's Trading Heart</h3>
            <p>Kejetia Market is one of the largest open-air markets in West Africa, a vast, labyrinthine marketplace where thousands of traders sell everything from fresh produce, spices, and textiles to traditional medicine, beads, and household goods. The market covers over 12 hectares and is organized by product, so entire sections are devoted to fabrics, another to foodstuffs, and others to handcrafted goods. Navigating Kejetia is an overwhelming sensory experience and the ultimate immersion in Ghanaian commercial culture. A local guide is invaluable for finding the best treasures.</p>

            <h3>Kente Weaving in Bonwire</h3>
            <p>The village of Bonwire, just outside Kumasi, is the legendary birthplace of kente cloth, one of the most iconic and recognizable textiles in the world. According to Ashanti legend, two hunters learned the art of weaving by watching a spider (Ananse) spinning its web. Today, master weavers sit at narrow wooden looms, their hands and feet working in mesmerizing rhythm to produce strips of silk and cotton fabric with intricate geometric patterns. Each kente design has a specific name and symbolic meaning, often referencing proverbs, historical events, or moral teachings.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Living Ashanti Culture</h3>
            <p>Kumasi is the beating heart of Ashanti culture, which remains one of the most vibrant and well-preserved traditional cultures in Africa. The Ashanti Kingdom, founded in the late 17th century, once rivaled European empires in wealth, military power, and administrative sophistication. Today, Ashanti traditions of chieftaincy, festivals, and craftsmanship continue to shape daily life. The Prempeh II Jubilee Museum houses royal regalia including a replica of the sacred Golden Stool, war trophies, and ceremonial objects that tell the story of this remarkable civilization.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Kumasi Airport (KMS) receives domestic flights from Accra (45 minutes) operated by Africa World Airlines and PassionAir. The road from Accra to Kumasi takes approximately 4-5 hours via the well-maintained N6 highway. VIP and STC intercity buses offer comfortable, affordable service with multiple daily departures. Shared taxis (trotros) are the budget option. The journey passes through the Ashanti region's lush cocoa-growing landscape. Within Kumasi, shared taxis and trotros are the main transport, though ride-hailing apps are increasingly available.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The dry season from November to March offers the most comfortable conditions for exploring Kumasi, with warm temperatures around 25-32&deg;C and minimal rainfall. December and January may bring Harmattan haze from the Sahara but remain dry. The rainy season (April to October) sees frequent afternoon thunderstorms that can flood unpaved roads to craft villages, though mornings are typically dry. Time your visit to coincide with an Akwasidae festival for the most immersive cultural experience; check dates locally as they follow the traditional 42-day Akan calendar cycle.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Kumasi is very affordable for international visitors. Budget travelers can manage on $25-40 per day with guesthouses and local restaurants. Mid-range hotels cost $40-100 per night. Meals at local chop bars (eateries) cost 15-30 GHS. A full-day craft village tour with a guide and transport runs 200-400 GHS. Manhyia Palace entry is 50 GHS. Cash is essential in markets and craft villages; ATMs are available in the city center and at major banks. Bargaining is expected and part of the cultural experience at Kejetia Market.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Hire a local guide for Kejetia Market; it is enormous and overwhelming without one. When visiting Manhyia Palace, dress respectfully and avoid wearing black or red, which are mourning colors in Ashanti culture. Ask permission before photographing people, especially at ceremonies. Learn a few Twi greetings: "Maakye" (good morning) and "Medaase" (thank you) go a long way. Try local dishes like fufu with light soup, kelewele (spiced plantain), and waakye (rice and beans). The best kente prices are found directly in Bonwire village rather than in Kumasi shops.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Kente is a hand-woven silk and cotton fabric that originated with the Ashanti people and is one of Africa's most recognizable textiles. The cloth features vibrant geometric patterns in bold colors, with each design carrying specific symbolic meaning related to Ashanti history, philosophy, and proverbs. The village of Bonwire, approximately 18 kilometers from Kumasi, is the birthplace and primary production center of kente cloth. Here you can watch master weavers working on traditional narrow-strip looms, learn about the symbolism of different patterns, and purchase authentic kente directly from the craftspeople.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">What is the Akwasidae festival?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">The Akwasidae is a sacred festival held every six weeks (following the Akan 42-day calendar cycle) at Manhyia Palace in Kumasi. During the celebration, the Asantehene (Ashanti King) holds court in full regalia, seated on a replica of the legendary Golden Stool, while sub-chiefs and queen mothers pay their respects in a display of drumming, dancing, and ceremonial pageantry. The festival honors ancestors, reaffirms political alliances, and celebrates Ashanti cultural identity. Visitors are welcome but should dress respectfully, ask permission before photographing, and follow the guidance of palace officials.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How many days do you need in Kumasi?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Two to three days is sufficient to experience Kumasi's main attractions. On day one, visit Manhyia Palace Museum in the morning, then explore the vast Kejetia Market and the Prempeh II Jubilee Museum. On day two, take a craft village tour: visit Bonwire for kente weaving, Ntonso for adinkra cloth stamping, and Ahwiaa for woodcarving. If you have a third day, visit the Kumasi Fort and Military Museum, the Okomfo Anokye Sword site, and the KNUST campus with its cultural center. Time your visit to coincide with an Akwasidae festival (every six weeks) for the most culturally immersive experience.</p>
