June to August offers the best conditions with cool, dry weather and excellent visibility. The wet summer months (October to March) bring lush green landscapes, newborn animals, and exceptional birding with migratory species present, but denser vegetation can make spotting animals more challenging.

The park has an extensive network of well-maintained tar and gravel roads accessible with a standard 2WD vehicle. Self-driving allows you to explore at your own pace and spend as much time as you like at sightings. Speed limits are 50 km/h on tar roads and 40 km/h on gravel. You must stay in your vehicle at all times except at designated picnic spots and rest camps. Gates open at sunrise and close at sunset, and you must reach your camp before gate closing time. Download the Latest Sightings app for real-time animal location reports."

Lower Sabie is widely considered the best for game viewing, set on the Sabie River with frequent elephant, hippo, and lion sightings nearby. Satara in the central region offers the best predator viewing, particularly lion and cheetah, in the surrounding grasslands. Olifants has the most spectacular views from its clifftop perch above the Olifants River. For a more remote wilderness experience, Letaba and Shingwedzi in the north offer solitude and excellent elephant and buffalo viewing."

          "text": "A minimum of three to four nights is recommended to experience Kruger properly. This allows for early morning and late afternoon game drives when animals are most active, and time to cover different ecosystems within the park. Five to seven nights is ideal, allowing you to explore both the southern section (best for general Big Five viewing) and the central section (best for predators and elephants). If combining with the Sabi Sands private reserve for walking safaris and off-road tracking, add two to three nights. Many visitors combine Kruger with the Panorama Route (Blyde River Canyon, God's Window) for a complete one to two week itinerary."

          <h2>Kruger: Africa's Iconic Safari Destination</h2>
          <p>One of the world's greatest wildlife sanctuaries, offering everything from self-drive adventures to luxury private reserves in a landscape teeming with the Big Five.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-grid">
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The Big Five &amp; Beyond</h3>
            <p>Kruger National Park is home to an extraordinary concentration of wildlife: approximately 2,000 lions, 1,000 leopards, 12,000 elephants, 5,000 rhinos (both black and white), and 27,000 buffalo. Beyond the Big Five, the park shelters over 147 mammal species including cheetah, wild dog, hippo, giraffe, zebra, and a staggering array of antelope species. The southern region between Skukuza and Lower Sabie offers the highest density and diversity of wildlife, making it the most popular area for first-time visitors.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Self-Drive Safari Freedom</h3>
            <p>Kruger is one of Africa's premier self-drive destinations, with over 2,500 kilometers of well-maintained roads. Tar roads connect the major rest camps, while a network of gravel roads provides access to quieter areas. Self-driving gives you complete freedom to set your own pace, follow animal sightings, and stop wherever you choose. Popular routes include the S28 along the Sabie River, the H4-1 between Skukuza and Lower Sabie (arguably the park's best road for game viewing), and the S100 loop near Satara for predator sightings.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Sabi Sands: Ultimate Luxury Safari</h3>
            <p>Bordering Kruger's southwestern boundary, the Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve is home to some of Africa's most prestigious safari lodges, including Londolozi, MalaMala, and Singita. With no fences between Sabi Sands and Kruger, animals roam freely across both reserves. The key advantages of Sabi Sands are off-road driving for close-up animal encounters, guided bush walks, night drives with spotlights, and remarkably habituated leopards that allow extraordinary close viewing. It is widely regarded as the best place in Africa for leopard sightings.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Exceptional Birding Paradise</h3>
            <p>With over 500 recorded bird species, Kruger ranks among Africa's top birding destinations. The park is home to all six of South Africa's vulture species, the iconic lilac-breasted roller, martial eagles, saddle-billed storks, and the elusive Pel's fishing owl. The summer months (October to March) are best for birding when migratory species swell the list. Birding hotspots include the Pafuri area in the far north (home to over 350 species), the rivers around Lower Sabie, and the Olifants River ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport (MQP) near Nelspruit and Hoedspruit Eastgate Airport (HDS) both receive flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town via Airlink, FlySafair, and CemAir. The park has nine entrance gates; Numbi and Phabeni gates near Hazyview are closest to MQP (approximately 45 minutes). From Johannesburg, it's a 4-5 hour drive on well-maintained highways. Car rental is essential for self-drive safaris and is available at both airports and in Nelspruit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The dry winter months (May to September) offer the best game viewing as vegetation thins, animals gather at water sources, and cooler temperatures make for comfortable drives. June to August provides excellent conditions with clear skies and cool mornings. The wet summer (October to March) brings lush landscapes, migratory birds, and newborn animals, but denser bush makes spotting harder. October (start of rains) and April (end of rains) are excellent shoulder months. Book camps well in advance for school holiday periods in June-July and December-January.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Kruger offers a range of budgets. SANParks conservation fees are approximately 440 ZAR per adult per day. Self-catering rest camp accommodation ranges from 600-2,500 ZAR per unit per night. Guided game drives cost around 350-550 ZAR per person. Budget self-drivers can manage on $60-100 per day including fuel, park fees, and camp accommodation. Sabi Sands private lodges typically cost $400-2,000 per person per night all-inclusive. A Wild Card annual pass provides unlimited access and is worthwhile for stays of four or more days.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Book rest camps through SANParks up to 11 months in advance, especially for Lower Sabie and Satara. Start game drives at gate opening time for the best sightings. Carry binoculars and a good field guide. Download the Latest Sightings app to track real-time animal reports from other visitors. Fill your fuel tank at every opportunity as distances are large. Obey speed limits strictly; animals can appear suddenly. Never exit your vehicle outside designated areas. The H4-1 between Skukuza and Lower Sabie is the single best road in the park for consistent Big Five sightings.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">Yes, Kruger National Park is one of Africa's best self-drive safari destinations. The park has an extensive network of well-maintained tar and gravel roads accessible with a standard 2WD vehicle. Self-driving allows you to explore at your own pace and spend as much time as you like at sightings. Speed limits are 50 km/h on tar roads and 40 km/h on gravel. You must stay in your vehicle at all times except at designated picnic spots and rest camps. Gates open at sunrise and close at sunset, and you must reach your camp before gate closing time.

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">Which Kruger rest camp is best?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">The best camp depends on your priorities. Skukuza is the largest and most centrally located, with excellent facilities including restaurants, shops, and a golf course. Lower Sabie is widely considered the best for game viewing, set on the Sabie River with frequent elephant, hippo, and lion sightings nearby. Satara in the central region offers the best predator viewing, particularly lion and cheetah, in the surrounding grasslands. Olifants has the most spectacular views from its clifftop perch above the Olifants River. For a more remote wilderness experience, Letaba and Shingwedzi in the north offer solitude and excellent elephant and buffalo viewing.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How many days do you need in Kruger National Park?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">A minimum of three to four nights is recommended to experience Kruger properly. This allows for early morning and late afternoon game drives when animals are most active, and time to cover different ecosystems within the park. Five to seven nights is ideal, allowing you to explore both the southern section (best for general Big Five viewing) and the central section (best for predators and elephants). If combining with the Sabi Sands private reserve for walking safaris and off-road tracking, add two to three nights. Many visitors combine Kruger with the Panorama Route (Blyde River Canyon, God's Window) for a complete one to two week itinerary.</p>
