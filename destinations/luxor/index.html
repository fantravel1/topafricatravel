Flights launch at dawn, typically around 5-6 AM, for the calmest wind conditions and most spectacular light over the temples and Valley of the Kings. Choose licensed operators with strong safety records and well-maintained equipment. Flights last approximately 45 minutes to one hour and float over the ancient monuments, sugar cane fields, and the Nile. Flights are cancelled in windy or adverse weather conditions. Prices range from $80-150 per person."

Day two should be dedicated to the West Bank: the Valley of the Kings, Temple of Hatshepsut, Medinet Habu, and the Colossi of Memnon. Day three, take a hot air balloon flight at sunrise, then visit the Luxor Museum and enjoy a felucca ride on the Nile at sunset. A fourth day allows for a day trip to the temples at Dendera and Abydos."

          <h2>Luxor: Gateway to Ancient Egypt</h2>
          <p>The ancient city of Thebes, now Luxor, holds the greatest concentration of ancient monuments anywhere on Earth, split between the East and West Banks of the Nile.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-grid">
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Valley of the Kings: Tombs of the Pharaohs</h3>
            <p>Carved deep into the limestone cliffs of the Theban Hills, the Valley of the Kings contains over 60 tombs of Egypt's most powerful rulers from the 16th to 11th centuries BC. Here, Howard Carter discovered the intact tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, one of archaeology's greatest moments. The tombs feature remarkably preserved wall paintings depicting the pharaohs' journey to the afterlife, with vivid colors that have survived over 3,000 years in the dry desert air.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Karnak Temple: Monument to the Gods</h3>
            <p>Karnak is the largest ancient religious complex in the world, built and expanded over 2,000 years by more than 30 pharaohs. The Great Hypostyle Hall, with its 134 massive columns standing up to 24 meters tall, is one of the most awe-inspiring architectural achievements in human history. The Avenue of Sphinxes, Sacred Lake, and numerous obelisks create a vast landscape of stone that was the most important place of worship in ancient Egypt. The Sound and Light Show brings the complex alive after dark.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Temple of Hatshepsut: A Queen's Legacy</h3>
            <p>The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari is one of ancient Egypt's most visually striking monuments. Built for Egypt's most famous female pharaoh, the temple rises in three terraced levels against dramatic limestone cliffs. Its colonnaded design, considered a masterpiece of ancient architecture, depicts Hatshepsut's divine birth, her legendary trading expedition to the land of Punt, and her coronation. The temple's setting in a natural amphitheatre of rock makes it profoundly dramatic.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The Nile: Lifeblood of Luxor</h3>
            <p>The Nile River divides Luxor into two distinct worlds. The East Bank, where the sun rises, was the land of the living with its great temples of Karnak and Luxor. The West Bank, where the sun sets, was the realm of the dead with the Valley of the Kings and mortuary temples. Today, felucca sailboats and luxury cruise ships glide past the same timeless scenery that inspired the pharaohs. A sunset felucca ride remains one of Luxor's most magical experiences.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Luxor International Airport (LXR) receives domestic flights from Cairo (1 hour) and seasonal international charters from Europe. EgyptAir and Nile Air operate multiple daily Cairo-Luxor flights. Many visitors arrive by Nile cruise from Aswan (3-4 nights) or by overnight sleeper train from Cairo. The train journey takes approximately 9-10 hours and is a budget-friendly option. Tour operators also arrange private transfers from Hurghada on the Red Sea coast (approximately 4 hours by road).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>October to April offers the most comfortable weather for temple exploration, with daytime temperatures around 22-30&deg;C. November to February is peak tourist season with pleasant days and cool evenings requiring a light jacket. March and April can see khamsin sandstorms. Summer (May-September) brings extreme heat regularly exceeding 45&deg;C, making outdoor sightseeing between 10 AM and 4 PM very challenging. If visiting in summer, plan all temple visits for dawn and late afternoon.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Luxor is one of Egypt's most affordable tourist destinations. Budget travelers can manage on $30-50 per day with basic hotels and local restaurants. Mid-range hotels with pool run $50-120 per night. Temple entrance tickets range from 100-300 EGP each, with premium tombs like Tutankhamun's and Seti I's costing extra. A hot air balloon ride costs $80-150. Felucca rides start at $15 per hour. Hire a West Bank taxi for a full day at 500-800 EGP. Bargaining is expected everywhere except ticket offices.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Start West Bank visits as early as possible to beat the heat and tour bus crowds. Buy a photography permit at the Valley of the Kings if you want to photograph inside tombs. Carry plenty of water, sunscreen, and a hat. Consider a Luxor Pass for unlimited site access if visiting multiple monuments. Beware of persistent touts at temple entrances; a firm but polite "no thank you" works best. The Luxor Corniche along the Nile is perfect for evening strolls. Local restaurants on Sharia al-Mahatta offer excellent, inexpensive Egyptian cuisine.</p>

Tutankhamun's tomb and the tomb of Ramesses VI require separate additional tickets purchased at the entrance. Over 60 tombs have been discovered in the valley, but only about 15-20 are open to visitors at any given time. Highlights often include the tombs of Ramesses III, Ramesses IV, Merenptah, and Seti I (which requires a premium ticket). Photography inside the tombs requires a separate photography permit. Arrive early in the morning to avoid tour bus crowds.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">Hot air balloon rides over Luxor's West Bank are a popular and generally safe activity when booked with reputable operators. Flights launch at dawn, typically around 5-6 AM, for the calmest wind conditions and most spectacular light over the temples and Valley of the Kings. Choose licensed operators with strong safety records and well-maintained equipment. Flights last approximately 45 minutes to one hour and float over the ancient monuments, sugar cane fields, and the Nile. Flights are cancelled in windy or adverse weather conditions. Prices range from $80-150 per person.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How many days do you need in Luxor?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Three to four days is ideal for exploring Luxor's highlights. Spend day one on the East Bank visiting Karnak Temple in the morning and Luxor Temple in the evening when it's beautifully illuminated. Day two should be dedicated to the West Bank: the Valley of the Kings, Temple of Hatshepsut, Medinet Habu, and the Colossi of Memnon. Day three, take a hot air balloon flight at sunrise, then visit the Luxor Museum and enjoy a felucca ride on the Nile at sunset. A fourth day allows for a day trip to the temples at Dendera and Abydos.</p>
