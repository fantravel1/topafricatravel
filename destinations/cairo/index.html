            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Cairo International Airport (CAI) is Africa's busiest airport and a major hub connecting to every continent. Airlines including EgyptAir, Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, and British Airways serve Cairo. E-visas are available for many nationalities. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi (30-45 minutes), ride-hailing apps, and the Cairo Metro.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>October to April offers the most comfortable sightseeing weather. Winter (December-February) is peak season with mild temperatures of 15-22°C. Spring and autumn are warm but pleasant. Avoid June to September when temperatures regularly exceed 40°C. Ramadan affects restaurant hours but offers unique cultural experiences for those visiting during the holy month.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Cairo is very affordable for international travelers. Budget travelers can manage on $25-40 per day with hostel stays and street food. Mid-range hotels and restaurants run $60-120 per day. Luxury Nile-view hotels start at $150+. Entrance fees to major sites like the Pyramids and museums are reasonable. Tipping (baksheesh) is a cultural norm and expected for many services.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Use ride-hailing apps (Uber/Careem) to avoid taxi price negotiations. Carry small bills for tips. Dress modestly when visiting mosques and churches. Cairo traffic is legendary, so allow extra travel time. The Cairo Metro is efficient for crossing the city. Avoid touts at tourist sites by having your own guide or a firm "la shukran" (no thank you). Drink bottled water only.</p>

The museum features state-of-the-art exhibition halls, conservation laboratories, and stunning views of the pyramids.
