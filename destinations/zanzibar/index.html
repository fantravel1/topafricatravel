Reserve two to three days for beach relaxation, snorkeling, or diving at Nungwi, Kendwa, or Paje. If you want to visit Jozani Forest and The Rock Restaurant, add an extra day.

          <p>A tropical archipelago steeped in Swahili culture, aromatic spices, and surrounded by some of the Indian Ocean's most beautiful beaches.</p>

            <h3>Stone Town: A Living Museum</h3>
            <p>Stone Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the cultural heart of Zanzibar. Its labyrinthine alleyways wind past ornately carved wooden doors, crumbling Arab mansions, bustling bazaars, and the former Sultan's Palace. This is where African, Arab, Indian, and European influences have converged for over a millennium. Visit the House of Wonders, the Old Fort, and the Anglican Cathedral built on the site of the last slave market in East Africa.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Pristine Beaches &amp; Turquoise Waters</h3>
            <p>Zanzibar's coastline is ringed with some of the world's most stunning beaches. Nungwi Beach on the northern tip offers consistent swimming regardless of tides, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and spectacular sunsets. Kendwa is renowned for its full moon parties and calm waters. Paje on the east coast is a global kitesurfing hotspot, while the secluded beaches of Matemwe offer tranquil seclusion and world-class reef snorkeling just offshore.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The Spice Island Heritage</h3>
            <p>Zanzibar earned its nickname as the Spice Island through centuries of spice cultivation and trade. Guided spice tours take you through lush plantations where cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper, vanilla, lemongrass, and cardamom grow in abundance. You'll learn to identify plants by scent and taste, discover traditional medicinal uses, and sample freshly prepared spice-infused dishes. These tours provide a fragrant journey through the island's agricultural soul.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Jozani Forest &amp; Red Colobus Monkeys</h3>
            <p>Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park is Zanzibar's only national park and the last stronghold of the endangered Zanzibar red colobus monkey, found nowhere else on Earth. Wooden boardwalks wind through ancient mangrove swamps and tropical forest where these charismatic primates swing through the canopy overhead. The park also shelters Sykes monkeys, bush babies, over 50 butterfly species, and rare endemic birds in a compact but incredibly biodiverse ecosystem.</p>

High-speed ferries from Dar es Salaam take 1.5 to 2 hours, with multiple daily departures by Azam Marine. Most nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival or apply online via the Tanzania e-visa system. Many visitors combine Zanzibar with a mainland safari, flying in from the Serengeti or Kilimanjaro.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The dry season from June to October brings warm, rain-free days perfect for beach holidays and diving, with temperatures around 25-28&deg;C. December to February is hotter at 28-33&deg;C with mostly clear skies. Avoid the long rains from March to May when heavy downpours can disrupt travel and some hotels close. The short rains in November are usually brief afternoon showers that rarely spoil a holiday. Diving visibility is best from October to March.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Zanzibar is moderately priced for a tropical island destination. Budget travelers can manage on $50-80 per day with guesthouses in Stone Town and local restaurants. Mid-range beachfront hotels run $100-250 per night. Luxury resorts start at $300 and can exceed $1,000. US dollars are widely accepted alongside Tanzanian Shillings. ATMs are available in Stone Town but less common elsewhere. Spice tours cost around $25, and diving trips start at $60 per dive.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Zanzibar is predominantly Muslim, so dress modestly when walking through Stone Town and villages. Cover shoulders and knees away from the beach. Bargaining is expected in markets and with taxi drivers. Always agree on a price before getting into a taxi. The evening Forodhani Gardens night food market is a must-visit for affordable, delicious street food. Carry cash for smaller establishments. Malaria precautions are recommended, and tap water should be avoided.</p>

Zanzibar is a predominantly Muslim island, so dressing modestly (covering shoulders and knees) when away from the beach shows respect for local culture. Swim only at beaches with calm waters, as some areas have strong currents and tidal changes.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Most visitors spend five to seven days in Zanzibar to enjoy a mix of culture and relaxation. Spend two days exploring Stone Town's historic sites, markets, and Freddie Mercury's house. Dedicate one day to a spice tour and one day to a trip to Prison Island or a dhow cruise. Reserve two to three days for beach relaxation, snorkeling, or diving at Nungwi, Kendwa, or Paje. If you want to visit Jozani Forest and The Rock Restaurant, add an extra day. Many travelers combine Zanzibar with a mainland Tanzania safari.</p>
