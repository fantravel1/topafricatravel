            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Use Uber or Bolt for safe, affordable transport around the city. Book Table Mountain cableway tickets online to avoid long queues. Reserve Robben Island ferry tickets well in advance as they sell out quickly. Carry layers as Cape Town weather can change rapidly. The MyCiTi bus system covers key tourist routes. Tipping of 10-15% is customary at restaurants. Load shedding (power outages) can occur, so carry a portable charger.</p>
