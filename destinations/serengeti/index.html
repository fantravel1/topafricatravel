            <h3>The Great Migration</h3>
            <p>The Great Migration is the largest mass movement of land animals on Earth. Over two million wildebeest, accompanied by hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles, follow an ancient clockwise circuit between the Serengeti and Kenya's Maasai Mara. The dramatic river crossings at the Mara and Grumeti rivers, where crocodiles lie in wait, are among nature's most thrilling spectacles.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Big Five &amp; Beyond</h3>
            <p>The Serengeti is one of the best places in Africa to see the Big Five: lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and rhinoceros. The park is home to the largest lion population on the continent, with an estimated 3,000 individuals. Cheetahs hunt on the open plains, leopards rest in sausage trees, and over 500 bird species fill the skies from martial eagles to lilac-breasted rollers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Diverse Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>The Serengeti's 14,763 square kilometers encompass remarkably diverse landscapes. The central Seronera Valley offers year-round game viewing with its riverine woodlands. The Western Corridor features the dramatic Grumeti River crossings. The northern Serengeti hosts the Mara River crossings. The southern Ndutu Plains come alive during calving season, creating a constantly changing safari experience.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Unforgettable Experiences</h3>
            <p>Beyond game drives, the Serengeti offers extraordinary experiences. Float silently over the plains at dawn in a hot air balloon. Stay in exclusive mobile camps that follow the migration herds. Walk with Maasai guides on foot safaris. Fall asleep to the sound of lions roaring under a canopy of stars. The Serengeti delivers moments that will stay with you forever.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Most visitors fly into Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO) or Julius Nyerere Airport in Dar es Salaam, then take a connecting bush flight to one of the Serengeti's airstrips (Seronera, Grumeti, Kogatende, or Ndutu). Bush flights from Arusha take approximately 1.5 hours. Overland access from Arusha takes 8-10 hours via the Ngorongoro Crater route, which many visitors include as part of a northern Tanzania safari circuit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The dry season (June-October) is peak safari season with excellent game viewing as animals concentrate around water sources. July-October is prime time for the dramatic Mara River crossings. January-March is calving season on the southern plains. The green season (April-May and November) offers lower prices, fewer crowds, and lush scenery with migratory birds, though some roads may be challenging.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Serengeti safaris are a significant investment. Budget camping safaris start at $200-350 per person per day. Mid-range tented camps run $400-800 per day. Luxury lodges range from $1,000-2,500+ per person per night all-inclusive. Park fees are $70.80 per adult per 24 hours. Balloon safaris cost approximately $500-600. Most safari packages are all-inclusive with meals, game drives, and park fees. Tipping guides $15-25 per day is customary.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Safari Tips</h3>
            <p>Book well in advance for peak season (July-October). Bring binoculars, a good camera with zoom lens, neutral-colored clothing, sunscreen, and a warm layer for early morning drives. Listen to your guide's expertise. Patience is key: the best sightings often come when you wait. Choose accommodation near where the migration herds are expected. Consider combining the Serengeti with Ngorongoro Crater for a complete northern Tanzania experience.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">The Great Migration is the largest mass movement of land animals on Earth, involving over two million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles moving in a continuous clockwise circuit between Tanzania's Serengeti and Kenya's Maasai Mara. The migration follows the rains and fresh grazing. From December to March, herds are in the southern Serengeti (Ndutu) for calving. April to June they move through the Western Corridor and Grumeti. July to October they cross the Mara River into Kenya. November they begin heading south again.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">The Serengeti offers diverse accommodation ranging from budget to ultra-luxury. Options include public campsites (basic, affordable), private tented camps (comfortable, mid-range), permanent luxury lodges with swimming pools and fine dining, exclusive mobile camps that follow the migration herds, and ultra-luxury properties with private guides and butlers. Popular choices include Seronera Wildlife Lodge in the central Serengeti, Four Seasons Safari Lodge, and mobile camps along the migration route. Booking well in advance is essential, especially for peak season (July-October).</p>
