          <h2>Chefchaouen: A Blue Jewel in the Rif Mountains</h2>
          <p>One of Africa's most photogenic towns, where every alley reveals a new shade of blue.</p>

        <div class="info-grid">
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The Blue-Painted Medina</h3>
            <p>Chefchaouen's medina is a mesmerizing labyrinth of blue-washed walls, narrow alleys, and flower-draped doorways. Unlike the bustling medinas of Fes or Marrakech, Chefchaouen's old town is intimate and peaceful. Every corner reveals a new shade of blue, from powder to cobalt to indigo, creating one of the most photogenic streetscapes in all of Africa. The tradition of blue-painting dates back decades and has become the town's signature identity.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Rif Mountains Gateway</h3>
            <p>Sitting at 600 meters in the Rif Mountains, Chefchaouen is surrounded by dramatic peaks, pine forests, and fertile valleys. The mountains offer superb hiking opportunities, from gentle day walks to challenging multi-day treks. The nearby Talassemtane National Park protects endangered Moroccan fir forests and offers trails through gorges, waterfalls, and traditional Berber villages where life has changed little over centuries.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Andalusian &amp; Berber Heritage</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1471 as a fortress against Portuguese invaders, Chefchaouen was later settled by Andalusian Muslims and Jews expelled from Spain. This dual heritage is visible in the town's architecture: whitewashed walls with blue accents, tiled fountains, internal courtyards, and arched doorways. The Kasbah in the main square houses a museum showcasing the region's rich cultural history and offers panoramic views from its gardens.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Artisan Crafts &amp; Local Flavors</h3>
            <p>Chefchaouen is a haven for artisan shopping. The medina's shops overflow with handwoven Rif blankets in bold geometric patterns, goat leather goods, handmade soap, and colorful pottery. Local cuisine features fresh goat cheese (jben), hearty mountain tagines, and mint tea served on rooftop terraces with mountain views. The town's relaxed atmosphere and friendly vendors make shopping a genuine pleasure.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Chefchaouen has no airport or train station. The nearest airports are Tangier Ibn Battouta (TNG, 3 hours) and Fes-Saiss (FEZ, 4 hours). CTM and Supratours buses run daily from Tangier (75 MAD, 3 hours), Fes (75-100 MAD, 4 hours), and Casablanca (180 MAD, 6.5 hours). Grand taxis from Tangier or Tetouan are faster and can be shared. Many travelers arrange private transfers through their riad for door-to-door convenience.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) offer the best weather with mild temperatures of 15-25&deg;C. Summer (June-August) can be hot, reaching 35&deg;C, but the mountain elevation keeps it cooler than lowland cities. Winter (December-February) brings rain and occasional snow in the mountains, but the medina is atmospheric and nearly tourist-free. Ramadan dates vary; the town is quieter but restaurants may have limited daytime hours.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>Chefchaouen has a wonderful range of riads (traditional guesthouses) and small hotels within the medina. Budget riads start from 250 MAD per night, mid-range options with rooftop terraces and mountain views run 400-800 MAD, and boutique riads with hammams go up to 1,500 MAD. Staying inside the medina is highly recommended for the atmosphere and convenience. Book ahead during peak seasons (April-May, September-October) and holidays.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Travel Tips</h3>
            <p>Wear comfortable walking shoes as the medina is hilly and cobbled. Dress modestly, covering shoulders and knees, especially when visiting mosques (non-Muslims cannot enter). Bring layers for mountain hikes and cool evenings. Cash is king; ATMs are available at the town entrance but some shops accept cards. Negotiate taxi fares before departing. The medina is safe to explore at night, but a flashlight helps in darker alleys.</p>

From Fes, the journey takes approximately 4 hours by bus (CTM or Supratours) and costs around 75-100 MAD. From Tangier, the journey is about 3 hours. Grand taxis (shared taxis) are also available from both cities and are slightly faster. There is no train station in Chefchaouen, so road transport is the only option. Many travelers arrange private transfers through their accommodation, which offers more flexibility and door-to-door service.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How many days should I spend in Chefchaouen?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Most travelers find 2-3 days ideal for Chefchaouen. One day is sufficient to explore the medina and main sights, but two days allows you to hike to the Spanish Mosque at sunset, visit Ras El Maa waterfall, explore the Kasbah museum, shop for local crafts, and simply soak in the relaxed atmosphere. A third day is perfect for a longer Rif Mountains hike to Akchour waterfalls or the God's Bridge natural rock formation. Chefchaouen's laid-back vibe encourages lingering.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Chefchaouen is known for several unique crafts and products. Handwoven blankets and wool garments in distinctive Rif Mountain patterns are a specialty. Goat cheese (jben) made from local Rif Mountain goats is a regional delicacy. Leather goods, including bags and babouche slippers, are widely available. The town is also known for its woven baskets, handmade soap, and colorful pottery. Unlike Fes or Marrakech, shopping in Chefchaouen is relatively low-pressure, with less aggressive haggling. Prices are generally lower than in larger Moroccan cities.</p>
