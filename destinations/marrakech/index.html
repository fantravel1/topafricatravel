The souks near Jemaa el-Fna are the most popular, but better deals can be found deeper in the medina."

            <p>Marrakech Menara Airport (RAK) is well connected with direct flights from major European cities, the Middle East, and several African capitals. Airlines including Ryanair, EasyJet, Royal Air Maroc, and Emirates serve the airport. The city is also accessible by train from Casablanca (3.5 hours) and by bus from other Moroccan cities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) offer the most pleasant weather for exploring. Summer temperatures regularly exceed 40°C, making sightseeing uncomfortable.

            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Marrakech offers excellent value. Budget travelers can manage on $30-50 per day staying in basic riads and eating street food. Mid-range riad stays with guided tours run $80-150 per day. Luxury riads and fine dining start at $200+. Bargaining is expected in souks. Tips of 10-15% are customary in restaurants. Carry small notes for tipping guides and porters.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Dress modestly in the medina, especially women. Always negotiate taxi fares before getting in. Refuse unofficial guides firmly but politely. Learn basic French or Arabic phrases for better interactions. The medina can be disorienting, so download offline maps. Carry small change for tips and mosque donations. Avoid eating from stalls with low turnover at Jemaa el-Fna.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">Marrakech's souks offer some of the best shopping in Africa. Popular purchases include handwoven Berber rugs and carpets, leather goods from the tanneries (bags, slippers, and belts), traditional Moroccan lamps and lanterns, argan oil products, spices from the spice market, hand-painted ceramics, silver jewelry, and traditional caftans. Bargaining is expected and part of the experience — start at roughly half the asking price and negotiate from there. The souks near Jemaa el-Fna are the most popular, but better deals can be found deeper in the medina.</p>
