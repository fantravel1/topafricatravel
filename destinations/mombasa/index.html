Flights from Nairobi's JKIA or Wilson Airport to Mombasa's Moi International Airport take about 1 hour, operated by Kenya Airways, Jambojet, and Fly540.

Standard precautions apply: avoid walking alone at night in quiet areas, keep valuables out of sight, and use reputable transport. Beach boys selling tours can be persistent but are generally harmless; a polite refusal works. Use hotel-recommended taxis or ride-hailing services for transport. The beach resort areas have private security, and the tourism police unit patrols popular areas. Always check current travel advisories before your trip."

Dedicate two to three days to Diani Beach for swimming, snorkeling, and water sports. Visit Haller Park and Nyali on another day. Add a day for a dhow sunset cruise and snorkeling in the Mombasa Marine National Park. If you have more time, day trips to Wasini Island for dolphin watching, Shimba Hills for wildlife, or the atmospheric ruins of Gedi provide excellent excursions. Many visitors combine Mombasa with a Masai Mara or Tsavo safari."

          <h2>Mombasa: Where Swahili Heritage Meets the Indian Ocean</h2>
          <p>Kenya's vibrant coastal capital blends a rich multicultural history with pristine beaches, coral reefs, and some of East Africa's finest cuisine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-grid">
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Fort Jesus: A UNESCO Masterpiece</h3>
            <p>Built by the Portuguese in 1593 to secure their trade route to India, Fort Jesus is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the finest examples of 16th-century Portuguese military architecture. The coral-stone fortress changed hands between the Portuguese and Omani Arabs nine times, and its walls tell the story of centuries of coastal power struggles. Today, the museum within houses an impressive collection of ceramics, weapons, and artifacts from shipwrecks, along with displays tracing Mombasa's role in the Indian Ocean trade networks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The Enchanting Old Town</h3>
            <p>Mombasa's Old Town is a living museum of Swahili culture, with narrow winding streets lined by coral-rag houses featuring intricately carved wooden doors and overhanging balconies. Arab, Indian, Portuguese, and African influences converge in the architecture, cuisine, and daily life of this historic quarter. Visit the Mandhry Mosque, one of the oldest in East Africa, browse the spice markets and antique shops, and listen to the call to prayer echoing through alleys that have welcomed traders and travelers for over a thousand years.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Diani Beach: Tropical Perfection</h3>
            <p>Consistently voted Africa's leading beach destination, Diani Beach stretches for 17 kilometers of powder-white sand backed by lush coastal forest. The turquoise waters are protected by a reef, creating calm conditions perfect for swimming and snorkeling. Kite surfing, deep-sea fishing, and glass-bottom boat rides are popular activities. The beach is lined with resorts ranging from budget to luxury, and the nearby Colobus Conservation center protects the endangered Angolan colobus monkeys that live in the surrounding forest canopy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Swahili Cuisine: Flavors of the Coast</h3>
            <p>Mombasa is the heartland of Swahili cuisine, a unique fusion shaped by centuries of Arab, Indian, and African culinary traditions. Must-try dishes include biryani pilau (spiced rice with meat), coconut fish curry, samosas, bhajias (vegetable fritters), and the iconic Swahili grilled seafood platters. Street food culture thrives in the Old Town and along the waterfront, where vendors serve mishkaki (grilled meat skewers), mahamri (sweet fried bread), and freshly pressed sugarcane juice. The annual Mombasa Food Festival celebrates this rich gastronomic heritage.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Moi International Airport (MBA) receives domestic flights from Nairobi (1 hour) and seasonal international flights. The Madaraka Express SGR train from Nairobi takes approximately 5 hours with two daily departures and is the most popular transport option. Book tickets online in advance. Driving from Nairobi takes 7-8 hours on the improved highway. From Mombasa, Diani Beach is reached via the Likoni Ferry (free for pedestrians, short wait for vehicles) or the new Diani bypass road. Tuk-tuks and matatus provide affordable local transport.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>January to March offers the hottest, driest weather at 28-33&deg;C with calm seas and excellent beach conditions. July to October is slightly cooler at 24-28&deg;C with clear skies and the best underwater visibility for diving and snorkeling. The long rains (April to June) bring heavy downpours but also the lowest prices and fewest tourists. The short rains (November) are usually brief afternoon showers. December is warm and festive but busy. The Mombasa Carnival in November is a vibrant cultural celebration worth timing your visit around.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Mombasa offers good value for a coastal destination. Budget travelers can manage on $40-70 per day with guesthouses and local restaurants. Mid-range beachfront hotels at Diani or Nyali run $80-200 per night. Luxury resorts start at $250. Fort Jesus entry is 1,200 KES for international visitors. A marine park snorkeling trip costs around $40-60. Dhow sunset cruises start at $50. Cash is preferred at local restaurants and markets, though cards are accepted at hotels and larger establishments. ATMs are available in Mombasa town and at Diani.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Mombasa has a significant Muslim population, so dress modestly when visiting the Old Town and away from the beach. Bargaining is expected in markets. The Likoni Ferry to Diani can have long vehicle queues during rush hours; foot passengers board quickly. Carry reef-safe sunscreen for marine park visits. Try fresh coconut water from beach vendors. Book the SGR train well in advance for weekend travel. Malaria precautions are recommended for the coast. The Mama Ngina Waterfront park offers beautiful free sunset views over the old port.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">The most popular option is the Madaraka Express SGR train, which takes approximately 5 hours from Nairobi Terminus to Mombasa Terminus. Trains depart twice daily, and tickets should be booked online in advance. First class offers comfortable seating with snack service at affordable prices. Flights from Nairobi's JKIA or Wilson Airport to Mombasa's Moi International Airport take about 1 hour, operated by Kenya Airways, Jambojet, and Fly540. Driving takes 7-8 hours on the improved Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The SGR train is generally the best balance of cost, comfort, and convenience.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">Is Mombasa safe for tourists?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Mombasa's main tourist areas including the beach resorts of Diani, Nyali, and Bamburi, as well as the Old Town and Fort Jesus area during daytime, are generally safe. Standard precautions apply: avoid walking alone at night in quiet areas, keep valuables out of sight, and use reputable transport. Beach boys selling tours can be persistent but are generally harmless; a polite refusal works. Use hotel-recommended taxis or ride-hailing services for transport. The beach resort areas have private security, and the tourism police unit patrols popular areas. Always check current travel advisories before your trip.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How many days do you need in Mombasa?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Four to six days allows you to experience Mombasa's diverse offerings. Spend one day exploring Fort Jesus, the Old Town, and the iconic Mombasa Tusks on Moi Avenue. Dedicate two to three days to Diani Beach for swimming, snorkeling, and water sports. Visit Haller Park and Nyali on another day. Add a day for a dhow sunset cruise and snorkeling in the Mombasa Marine National Park. If you have more time, day trips to Wasini Island for dolphin watching, Shimba Hills for wildlife, or the atmospheric ruins of Gedi provide excellent excursions. Many visitors combine Mombasa with a Masai Mara or Tsavo safari.</p>
