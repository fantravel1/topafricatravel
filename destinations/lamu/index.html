However, it's advisable to check your government's latest travel advisories before visiting, as the broader Lamu County (particularly the mainland areas) has occasionally experienced security concerns. Within Lamu Old Town and Shela, tourists walk freely, often unaccompanied, at all hours. The island's small, tight-knit community provides a natural sense of security. Exercise normal precautions with valuables and avoid isolated mainland areas."

Held annually in the third month of the Islamic calendar (Rabi ul-Awal), the festival has been celebrated on Lamu for over 100 years and attracts pilgrims and visitors from across East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Events include traditional Swahili poetry recitals, dhow races, donkey races, henna painting, Taarab music performances, and communal feasts. The festival typically lasts about a week and offers an extraordinary window into Swahili Islamic culture. Exact dates vary each year as they follow the lunar calendar."

This allows time to explore Lamu Old Town's narrow alleys and historic buildings (1 day), enjoy a full-day dhow sailing trip with snorkeling and a beach barbecue (1 day), relax on Shela Beach and explore Shela village (1 day), and visit the Lamu Museum, fort, and local workshops (half day). Those seeking deep relaxation can easily spend a week, as Lamu's slow pace encourages lingering. The island is also a wonderful base for day trips to neighboring islands like Manda and Pate, which have their own ruins and beaches."

          <h2>Lamu: A Living Swahili Heritage</h2>
          <p>One of East Africa's oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlements, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2001.</p>

            <h3>UNESCO Lamu Old Town</h3>
            <p>Lamu Old Town is the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa, with origins dating back to the 12th century. Its narrow labyrinthine streets, coral-stone buildings with ornately carved wooden doors, hidden courtyards, and verandahs have remained remarkably intact. The town's architecture reflects centuries of Swahili, Arab, Persian, Indian, and European influences. With no motorized vehicles, the old town retains an atmosphere of timeless authenticity that is unmatched along the East African coast.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Dhow Culture &amp; Sailing</h3>
            <p>The dhow, a traditional wooden sailing vessel, is central to Lamu's identity and daily life. For centuries, dhows connected the Swahili coast with Arabia, India, and Persia through the monsoon trade winds. Today, Lamu remains one of the few places where dhows are still built entirely by hand using centuries-old techniques. Sailing a dhow along the archipelago's mangrove channels and across to neighboring islands is one of East Africa's most iconic travel experiences.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Donkey-Only Streets</h3>
            <p>Lamu Old Town has no cars, motorcycles, or roads wide enough for vehicles. Donkeys have been the primary mode of transport for centuries, carrying everything from building materials to water. Today, approximately 3,000 donkeys navigate the narrow alleyways alongside pedestrians. The Lamu Donkey Sanctuary cares for the island's working animals and welcomes visitors. This vehicle-free existence gives the town its unique peaceful atmosphere and contributes to its UNESCO heritage status.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Shela Beach &amp; Island Life</h3>
            <p>Just a 40-minute walk or short boat ride from the old town, Shela village offers a quieter, more upscale experience. Its 12-kilometer stretch of pristine white sand beach is one of Kenya's most beautiful. Shela's boutique guesthouses, rooftop restaurants, and laid-back atmosphere have attracted artists, writers, and discerning travelers for decades. The village is backed by towering sand dunes and fronted by the warm Indian Ocean, creating a paradise for beach lovers and water sports enthusiasts.</p>

            <p>Daily flights operate from Nairobi's Wilson Airport and JKIA to Manda Island airstrip (1.5-2 hours) via Safarilink, Fly540, and Jambojet. From Manda, a motorboat crosses to Lamu town in 5 minutes. Buses from Mombasa reach the mainland jetty in 6-8 hours, followed by a speedboat crossing. There are no roads or vehicles on Lamu Island; all transport is by foot, donkey, or boat. Water taxis connect Lamu town, Shela, and Manda Island throughout the day.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>Lamu enjoys a tropical climate with temperatures of 23-32&deg;C year-round. The dry seasons (June-October and December-March) are ideal for beach activities and dhow sailing. The Maulidi Festival (dates follow the lunar calendar) is the cultural highlight. April-May brings the long rains, which can dampen the experience but green the island. The northeast monsoon (December-March) brings calmer seas, while the southeast monsoon (June-October) has stronger winds ideal for sailing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>Lamu offers a range from backpacker guesthouses (2,500-5,000 KES) to restored Swahili townhouses (8,000-15,000 KES) and exclusive boutique retreats in Shela (20,000-60,000 KES). Staying in Lamu Old Town immerses you in local life, while Shela offers beach proximity and upscale options. Many properties feature rooftop terraces with sea views, internal courtyards, and traditional Swahili decor. Book ahead during the Maulidi Festival and peak holiday periods (Christmas-New Year).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Cultural Etiquette</h3>
            <p>Lamu is a conservative Muslim community. Dress modestly, covering shoulders and knees, especially in the old town and away from the beach. Remove shoes before entering homes and mosques (non-Muslims generally cannot enter mosques). Alcohol is available in some hotels and restaurants but should be consumed discreetly. Ask permission before photographing people. Greetings are important in Swahili culture; a simple "Jambo" (hello) or "Habari" (how are you) is warmly appreciated.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">Is Lamu safe for tourists?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Lamu town and Shela village are generally safe for tourists, with a welcoming local community that depends on tourism. The island has a visible security presence. However, it's advisable to check your government's latest travel advisories before visiting, as the broader Lamu County (particularly the mainland areas) has occasionally experienced security concerns. Within Lamu Old Town and Shela, tourists walk freely, often unaccompanied, at all hours. The island's small, tight-knit community provides a natural sense of security. Exercise normal precautions with valuables and avoid isolated mainland areas.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">What is the Maulidi Festival?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">The Maulidi Festival is Lamu's most important cultural celebration, commemorating the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. Held annually in the third month of the Islamic calendar (Rabi ul-Awal), the festival has been celebrated on Lamu for over 100 years and attracts pilgrims and visitors from across East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Events include traditional Swahili poetry recitals, dhow races, donkey races, henna painting, Taarab music performances, and communal feasts. The festival typically lasts about a week and offers an extraordinary window into Swahili Islamic culture. Exact dates vary each year as they follow the lunar calendar.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How many days should I spend in Lamu?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Most travelers find 3-4 days ideal for Lamu. This allows time to explore Lamu Old Town's narrow alleys and historic buildings (1 day), enjoy a full-day dhow sailing trip with snorkeling and a beach barbecue (1 day), relax on Shela Beach and explore Shela village (1 day), and visit the Lamu Museum, fort, and local workshops (half day). Those seeking deep relaxation can easily spend a week, as Lamu's slow pace encourages lingering. The island is also a wonderful base for day trips to neighboring islands like Manda and Pate, which have their own ruins and beaches.</p>
