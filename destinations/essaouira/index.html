The city is nicknamed 'The Windy City of Africa' due to the strong, consistent trade winds (known locally as the Alizee) that blow almost year-round, particularly from April to November. The wide sandy beach south of the medina offers ideal conditions for all levels. Moulay Bouzerktoun, 25 km north, is a top spot for advanced riders. Multiple schools and rental shops line the beach, offering lessons from around 500-800 MAD for a 2-hour beginner session. Water temperatures range from 17-21 degrees Celsius, so a wetsuit is recommended."

The medina's restaurants serve excellent fish tagines and chermoula-marinated fish. Don't miss the famous Essaouira sardine brochettes. Beyond seafood, try traditional Moroccan dishes like lamb tagine with preserved lemons, pastilla (savory-sweet pie), and msemen (flatbread). For a unique local flavor, try argan oil-drizzled dishes and amlou, a delicious spread made from argan oil, almonds, and honey."

          <p>A UNESCO World Heritage medina, world-class winds, and a thriving arts scene on Morocco's most captivating coast.</p>

            <h3>UNESCO Medina &amp; Ramparts</h3>
            <p>Essaouira's medina, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a masterpiece of 18th-century military architecture designed by French architect Theodore Cornut. Unlike Morocco's other medinas, its streets follow a logical grid pattern, making it easy to explore. The dramatic sea-facing ramparts, lined with bronze cannons, offer sweeping views of the Atlantic, the Iles Purpuraires, and the fishing port below. The blue-shuttered, whitewashed buildings evoke a distinctly Mediterranean atmosphere.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Wind Sports Capital</h3>
            <p>Known as Africa's "Windy City," Essaouira is blessed with powerful, consistent trade winds that have made it a world-renowned destination for kitesurfing and windsurfing. The Alizee winds blow strongest from April to November, creating perfect conditions on the wide, sandy beach stretching south from the medina. International competitions are regularly held here, and the town has a vibrant community of wind sport enthusiasts from around the globe.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Gnaoua Music &amp; Arts Scene</h3>
            <p>Essaouira pulses with creative energy. The annual Gnaoua World Music Festival brings master musicians and hundreds of thousands of visitors each June. Gnaoua music, rooted in sub-Saharan African spiritual traditions, fills the medina's squares with hypnotic rhythms year-round. The town has long attracted artists, and its galleries, woodworking ateliers, and creative workshops make it Morocco's most vibrant arts hub. Jimi Hendrix's legendary visit in 1969 cemented its bohemian reputation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Argan Oil &amp; Fresh Seafood</h3>
            <p>The Essaouira region is the heartland of Morocco's argan oil production. Women's cooperatives outside town offer tours where you can watch the traditional extraction process and purchase pure argan oil for cooking and cosmetics. The fishing port is equally celebrated: fresh-caught sardines, sea bass, prawns, and lobster are grilled to perfection at the port-side stalls, creating one of Morocco's greatest culinary experiences at astonishingly affordable prices.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Essaouira is 175 km (2.5-3 hours) west of Marrakech by road. Supratours and CTM buses run multiple daily services (80-100 MAD). Grand taxis and private transfers are also available. Essaouira-Mogador Airport (ESU) receives seasonal flights from European cities. From Casablanca, the journey is approximately 6 hours by bus.

          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>Essaouira enjoys a mild Atlantic climate year-round, with temperatures rarely exceeding 28&deg;C in summer or dropping below 12&deg;C in winter. The wind season (April-November) is ideal for kitesurfing. Late June brings the Gnaoua Festival. September-October offers warm weather with calmer winds. Winter is quieter and atmospheric. Note that the wind can make the beach feel cooler than inland temperatures suggest; always bring a light jacket.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>Essaouira offers charming riads within the medina (300-1,500 MAD/night), boutique hotels with sea views along the ramparts, and budget hostels near the main square. For kitesurfers, beachfront guesthouses south of the medina provide easy access to the waves. The mellah (old Jewish quarter) has some of the most atmospheric accommodation. Book well ahead for the Gnaoua Festival period and peak summer months.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Travel Tips</h3>
            <p>Bring layers; the Atlantic breeze can be strong even in summer. Wear comfortable shoes for cobblestone streets. The medina is compact and walkable. Negotiate taxi fares before departure. ATMs are available inside the medina walls. The souk is closed on Fridays for prayers. Carry cash for the fish market stalls. Respect photographing locals, especially in the port area. Essaouira is one of Morocco's most relaxed and safe cities for travelers.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">Is Essaouira good for kitesurfing and windsurfing?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Essaouira is one of the world's premier kitesurfing and windsurfing destinations. The city is nicknamed "The Windy City of Africa" due to the strong, consistent trade winds (known locally as the Alizee) that blow almost year-round, particularly from April to November. The wide sandy beach south of the medina offers ideal conditions for all levels. Moulay Bouzerktoun, 25 km north, is a top spot for advanced riders. Multiple schools and rental shops line the beach, offering lessons from around 500-800 MAD for a 2-hour beginner session. Water temperatures range from 17-21 degrees Celsius, so a wetsuit is recommended.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How do I get to Essaouira from Marrakech?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Essaouira is approximately 175 km (2.5-3 hours) west of Marrakech by road. Supratours buses depart several times daily from Marrakech's bus station near the train station, costing around 80-100 MAD one way. The journey passes through scenic argan tree country. Private transfers and grand taxis are also available, running 800-1,200 MAD for the car. Essaouira has a small airport (ESU) with limited seasonal flights from European cities. Many travelers visit Essaouira as a 2-3 day side trip from Marrakech, making it an easy addition to any Morocco itinerary.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" itemprop="name">What food should I try in Essaouira?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Essaouira is a seafood paradise. The fish market near the port is legendary: choose from freshly caught sardines, sea bass, prawns, lobster, and calamari, then have them grilled on the spot for 50-150 MAD per plate. The medina's restaurants serve excellent fish tagines and chermoula-marinated fish. Don't miss the famous Essaouira sardine brochettes. Beyond seafood, try traditional Moroccan dishes like lamb tagine with preserved lemons, pastilla (savory-sweet pie), and msemen (flatbread). For a unique local flavor, try argan oil-drizzled dishes and amlou, a delicious spread made from argan oil, almonds, and honey.</p>
