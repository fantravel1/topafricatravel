The medina contains over 9,000 alleys and lanes with no vehicle access, making it the world's largest car-free urban zone and extremely easy to get lost in. An official guide (identifiable by their brass badge) will navigate the labyrinth, explain the historical significance of key sites, and help you avoid unofficial guides and touts. Half-day guided tours typically cost 300-500 MAD. After an initial guided tour, many visitors feel confident exploring independently."

The most common annoyance is unofficial guides and shop touts who may follow visitors; a polite but firm refusal usually suffices. Keep valuables close in crowded areas of the medina, and be cautious of pickpockets in busy souks. Walking at night in the medina is generally safe along main arteries but avoid poorly lit alleys. Women traveling alone may experience unwanted attention but serious incidents are rare. Use only official guides with brass identification badges."

On day one, dedicate a full day to Fez el-Bali with a licensed guide, visiting the Chouara tannery, Al-Qarawiyyin University exterior, Bou Inania Madrasa, and the souks. On day two, explore the Dar Batha Museum, the Jewish Quarter (Mellah), and the Royal Palace gates, then enjoy a traditional Moroccan cooking class. A third day allows for a pottery workshop in the Fez Pottery Cooperative, the Merenid Tombs for panoramic views, and a relaxing hammam experience. Day trips to Volubilis and Meknes are also possible."

            <h3>Fez el-Bali: The Ancient Medina</h3>
            <p>Fez el-Bali is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the world's largest car-free urban zone, with over 9,000 narrow alleys, lanes, and dead ends forming a seemingly impenetrable labyrinth. Founded in the 9th century, this living medieval city is home to nearly 200,000 residents, hundreds of mosques, workshops, and souks. Donkeys and handcarts remain the primary means of transport. The medina's sensory overload of sights, sounds, and smells creates one of the most immersive travel experiences on Earth.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Chouara Tannery: Ancient Craft</h3>
            <p>The Chouara Tannery is Fez's most iconic sight and one of the world's oldest, operating since the 11th century. From the terraces of surrounding leather shops, visitors gaze down at a honeycomb of stone vats filled with vivid natural dyes: saffron yellow, indigo blue, poppy red, and mint green. Workers wade barefoot through the pits, scraping and dyeing hides using the same techniques employed for nearly a thousand years. The pungent smell of pigeon droppings used in the curing process is unforgettable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Al-Qarawiyyin: World's Oldest University</h3>
            <p>Founded in 859 AD by Fatima al-Fihri, Al-Qarawiyyin is recognized by UNESCO and the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest continuously operating university. This extraordinary institution has been a center of Islamic learning for over 1,100 years, producing scholars, philosophers, and scientists who shaped world history. The mosque complex features stunning Andalusian-Moroccan architecture, though non-Muslims can only admire it from the doorways. The recently restored library opened limited public access to its precious manuscripts.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Master Artisans &amp; Pottery Workshops</h3>
            <p>Fez is Morocco's undisputed capital of traditional craftsmanship. The city's artisans produce exquisite zellige tilework, intricate brass lanterns, hand-woven textiles, and the famous blue-and-white Fassi pottery. Visit the Pottery Cooperative on the outskirts to watch master craftsmen shape, paint, and fire ceramics using techniques unchanged for centuries. In the medina, workshops specializing in leather, wood carving, and embroidery welcome visitors to observe their painstaking work and purchase directly from the makers.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Fez-Saiss Airport (FEZ) receives flights from major European cities including Paris, London, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, primarily via Ryanair, Royal Air Maroc, and Transavia. The airport is 15 km south of the city, with taxi rides to the medina costing around 150 MAD. Morocco's ONCF train network connects Fez to Casablanca (4 hours), Rabat (3 hours), Marrakech (7 hours), and Tangier (4 hours). CTM and Supratours buses also link Fez to all major cities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>Spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) offer the most comfortable temperatures at 20-28&deg;C, ideal for walking the medina's steep narrow streets. Summer temperatures can exceed 40&deg;C, making extended walks exhausting. Winter (December-February) is cool at 8-16&deg;C with occasional rain but very few tourists. The Fez Festival of World Sacred Music, usually held in June, is worth braving the heat for its world-class performances in stunning historic venues.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Fez offers exceptional value for money. Budget travelers can manage on $30-50 per day with basic riads and local eateries. Beautiful mid-range riads with courtyards run $60-150 per night. Luxury riads and palaces start at $200. A medina guide costs 300-500 MAD for a half day. Meals at local restaurants range from 30-80 MAD. Cash is king in the medina; carry small denominations. ATMs are available at Bab Boujloud and in the Ville Nouvelle. Bargaining is expected in all souks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Hire an official licensed guide (with brass badge) for your first medina visit. Wear comfortable flat shoes for the cobblestone streets. When you hear "balak!" step aside for passing donkeys or carts. Dress modestly, covering shoulders and knees. The best rooftop terraces for viewing the tanneries are in leather shops; you'll be expected to browse but not obligated to buy. Stay in a riad within the medina for the most authentic experience. Download offline maps as GPS can be unreliable in the narrow alleys.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">While not strictly necessary, hiring an official licensed guide is highly recommended for your first visit to Fez el-Bali. The medina contains over 9,000 alleys and lanes with no vehicle access, making it the world's largest car-free urban zone and extremely easy to get lost in. An official guide (identifiable by their brass badge) will navigate the labyrinth, explain the historical significance of key sites, and help you avoid unofficial guides and touts. Half-day guided tours typically cost 300-500 MAD. After an initial guided tour, many visitors feel confident exploring independently.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">Fez is generally safe for tourists. The medina is heavily policed and well-monitored. The most common annoyance is unofficial guides and shop touts who may follow visitors; a polite but firm refusal usually suffices. Keep valuables close in crowded areas of the medina, and be cautious of pickpockets in busy souks. Walking at night in the medina is generally safe along main arteries but avoid poorly lit alleys. Women traveling alone may experience unwanted attention but serious incidents are rare. Use only official guides with brass identification badges.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Two to three full days is ideal for exploring Fez. On day one, dedicate a full day to Fez el-Bali with a licensed guide, visiting the Chouara tannery, Al-Qarawiyyin University exterior, Bou Inania Madrasa, and the souks. On day two, explore the Dar Batha Museum, the Jewish Quarter (Mellah), and the Royal Palace gates, then enjoy a traditional Moroccan cooking class. A third day allows for a pottery workshop in the Fez Pottery Cooperative, the Merenid Tombs for panoramic views, and a relaxing hammam experience. Day trips to Volubilis and Meknes are also possible.</p>
