            <h3>Historic Jamestown</h3>
            <p>Jamestown is the soul of Accra, a historic fishing district founded in the 17th century around the British-built James Fort. Climb the Jamestown Lighthouse for panoramic views of the coastline, watch fishermen haul in their daily catch on the beach, explore the colonial-era architecture, and experience the raw, unfiltered energy of one of West Africa's oldest neighborhoods. During August, the Chale Wote Street Art Festival transforms Jamestown into an extraordinary open-air gallery.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Independence Square &amp; National Identity</h3>
            <p>Independence Square (Black Star Square) is the symbolic heart of Ghanaian nationhood. This vast public plaza, dominated by the Black Star Gate arch, commemorates Ghana's historic independence in 1957, the first sub-Saharan African nation to break free from colonial rule. Nearby, the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park honors Ghana's founding father with a striking mausoleum, museum, and tranquil gardens surrounded by fountains.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>A City That Never Sleeps</h3>
            <p>Accra's nightlife is legendary across Africa. From rooftop bars in Osu and East Legon to open-air Afrobeats clubs in Airport Residential and live highlife music venues in Labadi, the city pulses with energy after dark. The annual Detty December season (late November through January) draws the global Ghanaian diaspora home for a non-stop calendar of concerts, beach parties, and cultural events that have made Accra December's hottest destination.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The Jollof Rice Capital</h3>
            <p>Ghanaians will tell you without hesitation that their jollof rice is the best in the world, and a visit to Accra is your chance to judge for yourself. This beloved tomato-based rice dish, cooked with spices, onions, and often served with fried chicken or grilled tilapia, is a point of fierce national pride. Beyond jollof, Accra's food scene spans from bustling street-food stalls serving waakye and kelewele to innovative fine-dining restaurants reinterpreting traditional Ghanaian cuisine.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>Kotoka International Airport (ACC) is Accra's main gateway, receiving direct flights from major European, Middle Eastern, and African hubs. Airlines including British Airways, KLM, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, South African Airways, and Kenya Airways serve the airport. The airport is located just 10 km from the city center, and the ride takes 20-45 minutes depending on traffic. Uber and Bolt are reliable and affordable for airport transfers.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The dry season (November-March) offers the most comfortable weather for exploring Accra, with warm days, lower humidity, and Harmattan haze from the Sahara adding a unique atmospheric quality. December is peak season thanks to the Detty December festivities. The rainy season (April-July, September-October) brings afternoon thunderstorms but also lush greenery and fewer tourists. August is ideal for the Chale Wote festival and Homowo traditional celebrations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Accra is reasonably priced for international visitors. Budget travelers can manage on $30-50 per day with guesthouses and local eateries. Mid-range hotels with tours run $80-150 per day. Upscale accommodations in Airport Residential and East Legon start at $200+. Mobile money (MTN MoMo) is widely used alongside cash. ATMs are readily available. Credit cards are accepted at hotels and upscale restaurants but not at markets or smaller establishments.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Use Uber or Bolt for reliable transport, as Accra traffic can be intense. Always greet people before beginning a conversation, as courtesy is deeply valued in Ghanaian culture. Dress respectfully when visiting traditional areas or chiefs' palaces. Carry cash for markets and street food. The right hand is used for greetings and eating. Tipping of 10% is appreciated at restaurants. Try to visit Makola Market on a weekday morning for the best experience and fewer crowds.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">Accra is a food lover's paradise. The undisputed star is Ghanaian jollof rice, a richly spiced tomato rice dish that Ghanaians passionately claim is the best version in West Africa. Other must-try dishes include waakye (rice and beans with spicy shito sauce), banku and tilapia (fermented corn dough with grilled fish), kelewele (spiced fried plantains), and red-red (bean stew with fried plantain). For street food, head to Osu Night Market for grilled kebabs, or try the beloved chichinga (spiced meat skewers) from roadside vendors.</p>
