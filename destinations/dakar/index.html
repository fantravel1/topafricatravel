            <h3>Gor&eacute;e Island: Memory &amp; Resilience</h3>
            <p>Just a 20-minute ferry ride from Dakar, UNESCO-listed Gor&eacute;e Island is one of Africa's most important historical sites. The Maison des Esclaves (House of Slaves) stands as a powerful memorial to the transatlantic slave trade. The island's pastel-colored colonial buildings, bougainvillea-draped streets, and artist studios create a poignant contrast between beauty and the weight of history. A must-visit for every traveler to Senegal.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>The African Renaissance Monument</h3>
            <p>Standing 49 meters tall on the Collines des Mamelles, the African Renaissance Monument is the tallest statue in Africa and a powerful symbol of the continent's emergence from centuries of slavery and colonialism. Designed by Senegalese architect Pierre Goudiaby Atepa, the bronze monument depicts a man, woman, and child rising toward the sky. Visitors can climb to the observation deck inside the statue for sweeping views of the Atlantic and the Cap-Vert peninsula.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Dakar's Legendary Music Scene</h3>
            <p>Dakar is the undisputed music capital of West Africa. The city gave birth to mbalax, the infectious rhythm pioneered by Youssou N'Dour that blends Wolof percussion with Cuban jazz and funk. Every night, clubs in the Almadies and Plateau neighborhoods come alive with live performances. From the legendary Institut Fran&ccedil;ais to intimate mbalax clubs, Dakar's music scene rivals any in the world for energy, originality, and sheer joy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>A Culinary Capital</h3>
            <p>Senegalese cuisine is widely regarded as the finest in West Africa, and Dakar is where it shines brightest. Thieboudienne, the national dish of fish, rice, and vegetables in tomato sauce, is an art form here. Yassa poulet (lemon-onion chicken), maf&eacute; (peanut stew), and fresh grilled seafood on the Corniche define the flavors of the city. Street food stalls, beachside restaurants, and upscale dining rooms all celebrate Senegal's rich culinary heritage.</p>

            <p>Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS), opened in 2017, is located about 47 km from central Dakar. Airlines including Air France, Turkish Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, and Brussels Airlines serve the airport with connections from Europe, the Middle East, and across Africa. The new TER train connects the airport to central Dakar in about 45 minutes. Taxis and shared shuttles are also available.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The dry season (November-May) offers the best weather for visiting Dakar, with sunny skies, low humidity, and comfortable temperatures. December to February is especially pleasant with cooler evenings. The rainy season (June-October) brings heavy downpours and high humidity, though the landscape turns lush and green. The surf season peaks from September to March. Cultural festivals like the Dakar Biennale occur in May-June of even-numbered years.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Money &amp; Costs</h3>
            <p>Dakar is moderately priced by African capital standards. Budget travelers can manage on $30-50 per day with guesthouses and street food. Mid-range hotels with guided tours run $70-130 per day. Upscale hotels in the Almadies and Plateau areas start at $150+. The CFA Franc is pegged to the Euro, providing stable pricing. ATMs are widely available, though some markets and smaller establishments prefer cash.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Local Tips</h3>
            <p>Learn a few Wolof greetings such as "Nanga def?" (How are you?) to connect with locals. Dress modestly, especially in the Medina and during mosque visits. Negotiate taxi fares before departing. The concept of t&eacute;ranga (hospitality) is central to Senegalese culture, so accept offers of tea graciously. Carry small denominations for market purchases. Fridays are prayer days, and many shops close during midday prayers. Book Gor&eacute;e Island ferries for morning departures to avoid afternoon crowds.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Gor&eacute;e Island is reached by a 20-minute ferry ride from Dakar's main port near Place de l'Ind&eacute;pendance. Ferries depart roughly every one to two hours throughout the day, with the first departure around 6:15 AM and the last return around 10:30 PM. Tickets cost approximately 5,200 CFA francs (about $8 USD) for non-residents. It's best to arrive early, especially on weekends, as the ferry can fill up. The island is car-free and can be explored on foot in two to three hours.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Dakar is a culinary capital of West Africa. The must-try dish is thieboudienne (also spelled ceebu j&ecirc;n), Senegal's national dish of fish, rice, and vegetables slow-cooked in a rich tomato sauce. Other essential dishes include yassa poulet (chicken marinated in onion and lemon), maf&eacute; (peanut stew with meat), and pastels (fried fish pastries). For street food, try fataya (stuffed pastries) and dibi (grilled lamb). Wash it all down with bissap (hibiscus juice) or fresh baobab fruit juice called bouye.</p>
