          <h2>Why Visit Egypt?</h2>
          <p>A timeless destination where ancient wonders meet vibrant modern culture, all along the life-giving waters of the Nile.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>Egypt stands as one of the world's most extraordinary travel destinations, offering an unmatched combination of ancient history, natural beauty, and cultural richness. Home to the only remaining wonder of the ancient world -- the Great Pyramid of Giza -- Egypt has captivated travelers for millennia. The country's monuments, temples, and tombs chronicle a civilization that flourished for over three thousand years and continues to reveal new secrets to archaeologists today.</p>
          <p>Beyond its legendary antiquities, Egypt offers diverse experiences for every type of traveler. The Nile River, the longest in Africa, flows through the heart of the country, sustaining fertile valleys amid vast desert landscapes. A cruise along the Nile between Luxor and Aswan remains one of the most iconic journeys in world travel. Along the Red Sea coast, world-class coral reefs attract divers and snorkelers from around the globe, while the Mediterranean city of Alexandria blends ancient heritage with coastal charm.</p>
          <p>Egyptian culture is equally compelling. Cairo's bustling bazaars, aromatic street food, and warm hospitality create vivid sensory experiences. The country's Islamic and Coptic heritage adds layers of architectural splendor, from medieval mosques to ancient churches. Whether you come for the monuments, the diving, the desert, or the culture, Egypt delivers an experience that stays with you long after you leave.</p>

          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Luxor</h3>
            <p>Often called the world's greatest open-air museum, Luxor sits on the site of ancient Thebes. The east bank holds the magnificent Karnak and Luxor Temples, while the west bank reveals the Valley of the Kings, the Temple of Hatshepsut, and the Colossi of Memnon. This is where Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Aswan</h3>
            <p>Egypt's sunniest southern city offers a more relaxed pace along the beautiful upper Nile. Visit the Philae Temple dedicated to the goddess Isis, sail on a traditional felucca at sunset, explore colorful Nubian villages, and marvel at the engineering of the Aswan High Dam.

          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Abu Simbel</h3>
            <p>The twin rock-cut temples of Abu Simbel, built by Ramesses II in the 13th century BC, are among Egypt's most awe-inspiring monuments. Carved directly into a mountainside near Lake Nasser, the temples were famously relocated in the 1960s to save them from rising floodwaters -- one of the greatest feats of archaeological engineering ever accomplished.</p>

        <div class="info-grid">
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Visa Requirements</h3>
            <p>Most nationalities can obtain a tourist visa on arrival at Egyptian airports (approximately $25 USD) or apply for an e-visa online before travel. The standard tourist visa allows a 30-day stay. Some nationalities require advance embassy approval. Always verify the latest requirements with the Egyptian embassy in your country before departure.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Currency</h3>
            <p>The Egyptian Pound (EGP) is the official currency. ATMs are widely available in cities and tourist areas. US dollars and euros are widely accepted at hotels and tourist shops, but Egyptian pounds are needed for local markets, transport, and smaller establishments. Credit cards are accepted at most hotels and upscale restaurants.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Arabic is the official language, with Egyptian Arabic being the most widely spoken dialect. English is commonly spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and by guides. French is also understood in some areas. Learning a few Arabic phrases such as "shukran" (thank you) and "as-salamu alaykum" (peace be upon you) is appreciated by locals.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>October to April offers the most comfortable weather for sightseeing, with mild temperatures and minimal rainfall. December to February is peak season with the best conditions but larger crowds. Summer (May to September) brings intense heat, especially in Upper Egypt, but the Red Sea coast remains pleasant year-round for beach and diving holidays.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Getting Around</h3>
            <p>Domestic flights connect Cairo with Luxor, Aswan, Hurghada, and Sharm el-Sheikh efficiently. Trains run along the Nile Valley between Cairo, Luxor, and Aswan. Within cities, ride-hailing apps like Uber and Careem operate in Cairo and Alexandria. For the most immersive experience, Nile cruises combine transport with sightseeing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Health &amp; Safety</h3>
            <p>No mandatory vaccinations are required for Egypt, but hepatitis A, typhoid, and routine vaccinations are recommended. Drink bottled water and use sun protection. Tourist areas are well-policed and generally safe. Travel insurance covering medical evacuation is strongly recommended. The emergency number in Egypt is 122 for police and 123 for ambulance.</p>

          <h2>Culture &amp; Etiquette</h2>
          <p>Understanding Egyptian culture enriches your travel experience and shows respect for your hosts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>Egypt is a predominantly Muslim country with a significant Coptic Christian minority, and religion plays an important role in daily life. Visitors are welcomed warmly, and Egyptians are renowned for their hospitality and friendliness. The Arabic greeting "ahlan wa sahlan" (welcome) reflects the genuine openness you will encounter throughout the country.</p>
          <p>When visiting mosques and religious sites, dress modestly by covering shoulders and knees. Women may be asked to cover their hair in some mosques, so carrying a scarf is practical. During Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, be considerate by avoiding eating, drinking, or smoking in public during daylight hours. Ramadan evenings, however, are some of the most festive and communal times to experience Egyptian culture.</p>
          <p>Egyptians are proud of their heritage, which encompasses pharaonic, Coptic, Islamic, and modern influences. Engaging with this layered history respectfully and showing genuine interest will open doors to meaningful cultural exchanges. Tipping (baksheesh) is customary and an important part of the service economy. Small tips for guides, drivers, hotel staff, and restaurant servers are expected and appreciated.</p>
          <p>Egyptian cuisine is flavorful and diverse. National dishes include koshari (a hearty mix of rice, lentils, pasta, and spiced tomato sauce), ful medames (stewed fava beans), and ta'ameya (Egyptian falafel made from fava beans rather than chickpeas). Sharing a meal is central to Egyptian social life, and food is prepared with pride and generosity.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">The best time to visit Egypt is from October to April when temperatures are milder and comfortable for sightseeing. Winter months (December to February) are the peak tourist season with pleasant daytime temperatures of 20-25&deg;C (68-77&deg;F). Summer (May to September) can be extremely hot, especially in Upper Egypt where temperatures often exceed 40&deg;C (104&deg;F). The Red Sea coast is enjoyable year-round, with warm waters ideal for diving and snorkeling.</p>
